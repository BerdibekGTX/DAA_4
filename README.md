# Assignment 4: Smart City / Smart Campus Scheduling Case
### Student: Amir Berdibek

### Group: SE-2429

### Teacher: Sayakulova Zarina
## Goal:
In a smart campus scheduling system, courses and classroom locations are modeled as a directed graph. First, we detect Strongly Connected Components to group courses that depend on each other. Then, we apply Topological Ordering to determine the correct sequence of these course modules. After forming a DAG, we use Shortest Path in DAG algorithms to find the fastest student routes between buildings and minimize travel time across campus. This combined approach helps optimize both academic scheduling and campus movement efficiently.
